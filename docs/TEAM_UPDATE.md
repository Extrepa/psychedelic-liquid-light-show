Date: 2025-11-12
Owner: Engineering

Summary
- Preset system expanded and categorized (Core, Acid, Goofy, Nitrous, Healing, Blends) with one‑line descriptions.
- PresetStrip now includes category filters; new compact Presets panel shows grouped buttons for easy onboarding.
- Dropper now supports custom art (upload), size, rotation, and tip alignment offsets.
- Preview changed to transparent red with grid lines for clearer size feedback.
- Display: Brightness slider; optional Resize Flash and On‑Splat Flicker; Edge Runoff tuning; Parallax tilt.
- Input QoL: mouse wheel toggles Oil/Water; Cmd+wheel cycles colors.

User impact
- Simpler starting points via curated presets; easier color and mode discovery.
- Clearer drop size preview and a themed dropper tool that matches brand vibes.
- Stronger showmanship (flash/flicker) with opt‑out; edges feel physical via runoff.

Follow‑ups
- Favorites and search in Presets
- Finish test runner setup to resolve type errors in tests
- Re‑enable WebGL path after PIXI v8 shader fixes
- Mobile tip alignment preset per DPI (optional)
